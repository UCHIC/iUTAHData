                                            <p>Hydrologic model coupling efforts have become an increasingly important
                                                and central focus of modern water resources research. iUTAH is uniquely
                                                positioned with research initiatives requiring innovative approaches to
                                                resolve the human, natural, and social aspects of water use in Utah.
                                                We are developing a software coupling framework to enable
                                                cross-disciplinary, collaborative, and asynchronous research.
                                                This framework borrows conceptually from other projects (e.g. OpenMI and
                                                CSDMS)
                                                to form a data-centric modeling platform. We aim to bridge the gap
                                                between observed hydrologic data and simulation computations by

                                                automated loading of sensor data into relational databases. The

                                            <p>Monitoring networks frequently collect specimens of water, soil, and air
                                                for subsequent analysis. The documentation for these data are distinct
                                                and more extensive than that of time series data. We are collaborating
                                                with the <a href="http://www.odm2.org/">ODM2</a> and <a
