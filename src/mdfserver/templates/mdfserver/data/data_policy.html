            <h2>Data Policy</h2>
            <p>To define procedures and timeframes for publishing and sharing data, the CI Team has worked with the
                iUTAH leadership to develop and implement a data policy for all datasets developed as part of or
                supported by iUTAH. In general, iUTAH is committed to an open data policy to maximize the impact and
                broad use of datasets collected within iUTAH facilities and by iUTAH research teams. The Data Policy
                specifies a data typology and time frames for data and metadata submission and release. The Data Policy
                also calls for the submission of a Data Collection Plan for all data collection and creation efforts
                supported by iUTAH. The iUTAH Data Policy can be found <a
                        href="{% static 'mdfserver/documents/iUTAH_Data_Policy_V1.6_12-8-2014.pdf' %}"
                        target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
            <h2>Data Publication System</h2>
            <p>The iUTAH MDF is developing tools to assist iUTAH participants in discovering, visualizing, and accessing
                data in which they are interested. Some types of iUTAH data (e.g., GAMUT data) are being published using
                specialized applications and tools. However, most investigator datasets will be submitted and published
                using the <a href="http://repository.iutahepscor.org/">iUTAH Data Publication System</a>. This system
                permits the simultaneous submission and publication of data and metadata with functionality for search
                and discovery. The system facilitates storage, archival, and curation of important iUTAH datasets. Click
                <a href="http://repository.iutahepscor.org/">here</a> to submit a dataset or to view and access
                submitted resources.</p>
            <h2>Data Collection Plans</h2>
            <p>For all data creation efforts executed with any funding from iUTAH (salary, travel, sampling, equipment
                purchase, etc.), a brief plan for data collection should be submitted to the Data Policy Committee prior
                to the funding of data collection/creation. The Data Collection Plan should include the following
                information:</p>
            <ol style="margin-left: 5em; margin-top: -22px;">
                <li>Identification of the types of data to be created (using the data typology).</li>
                <li>A brief description of the methods that will be used to create the data.</li>
                <li>Identification of the data formats that will be used to store the data.</li>
                <li>A brief description of the data to be created (e.g., what are the final products that will be
                    uploaded to the iUTAH MDF for publication?).
                </li>
                <li>A description of who will have access to the data during data collection and how the data will be
                    made broadly available after completion and publication.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>For more information about data typology and timing of metadata and data submission, please refer to the
                iUTAH Data Policy Document. Here is a link a <a

                    Data Collection Plan</a> template. Submit data collection plans to <a

            <h2>Data Policy Committee</h2>
            <p>The iUTAH Data Policy was developed by the CI Team in conjunction with the iUTAH Data Policy Committee
                and approved by the iUTAH Management and Leadership Teams. Consisting of faculty, staff, and student
                members representing the iUTAH research groups, the Data Policy Committee advises the CI Team on
                prioritizing data products to include in the iUTAH MDF and advocates the implementation of iUTAH data
                policies and practices. In addition, the Data Policy Committee reviews and approves Data Collection
                Plans submitted by iUTAH researchers.</p>
