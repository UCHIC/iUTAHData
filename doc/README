Add pictures to site pages
- Create a folder in img in the static folder (iUTAHData/src/mdfserver/static/img)
- Put pictures there and name with sequence Site1.jpg, Site2.jpg, Site3.jpg... that's right you know how to count!
- That's all. The website will just read them when it is accessed.

Add new variables to sites
- Variables are limited in the dynamic pages by a variable named vars_to_show. To add or remove a variable from showing
in a site just add it to or remove it from the list.
